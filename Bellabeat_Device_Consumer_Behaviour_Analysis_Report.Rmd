## Project Description 
In this scenario, I serve as a Data Analyst on Bellabeat’s marketing analytics team, focusing on the company’s range of health-focused products for women which includes the Bellabeat App, Leaf wearable tracker, Time smartwatch, Spring smart bottle, and Bellabeat Membership. The company’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer believes that analysing smart device usage data can reveal key consumer behaviour trends and unlock new growth opportunities. My task is to analyse publicly available Fitbit Fitness Tracker data, matching it with one of these Bellabeat products to uncover usage patterns and insights that can inform marketing strategy for the chosen product. Insight uncovered can be extended to other Bellabeat products.
This report will be divided into sections corresponding to phaseS of the data analysis life cycle - Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, and Act.

## 1. Ask Phase
T asked SMART question and use structured thinking to clearly establish the project goals, requirements, and the overall scope as follows:

#### 1.1 Main Business Question:-
How do wearable smart device users’ daily activity and sleep patterns reflect opportunities for Bellabeat to market the Time smartwatch (and other products) more effectively to its target audience (health-conscious women)?

#### 1.2 Business Task Statement:-
Identify key behavioral trends from Fitbit smart device data analysis to provide actionable insights that can guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategies, enhance user personalization, and support sustainable business growth.

#### 1.3 Business Problem:-
Bellabeat, a growing innovator in women’s wellness technology, lacks comprehensive insight into consumer smart device usage. This project addresses that gap by analysing available smart device data to generate actionable insights, supporting more effective marketing strategies and product positioning in the competitive global smart device market.

#### 1.4 Business Value:-
This project will deliver actionable, data-driven recommendations that:
(a)	Provides Bellabeat executives with data-driven insights into consumer behaviour.
(b)	Enables Bellabeat executives to tailor marketing campaigns based on user habits and preferences.
(c)	Supports development of personalized product experiences that increase engagement and retention.
(d)	Provides evidence-based insights to inform strategic decisions for product positioning and messaging.

#### 1.5 Purpose of the Project: 
The purpose of this project is to analyse daily activity, heartrate, sleep and weight behaviour patterns of Fitbit device users to identify consumer trends that can guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy for the Time smartwatch.

#### 1.6 Scope of Work and Major Project Activities:-
```{r}
 Activities <- c("Data Collection", "Data Cleaning and Processing", "Data Analysis and Visualizations", "Comparative Analysis", "Marketing Insights and Recommendation", "Presentation of Results")
Description <- c("•	Source smart device usage data from publicly available datasets (e.g., Steps, sleep, activity level, heart rate)", "•	Clean the data by removing duplicates, correcting formatting issues (e.g., date), handling missing values, validate, standardizing names ensuring accuracy and consistency", "•	Conduct descriptive analysis of key metrics (steps, activity levels, sleep duration, weight). •	Identify demographic or lifestyle-based usage trends across activity, sleep, stress, hydration. •	Visualize findings through charts, graphs, and summary tables.", "•	Select one Bellabeat product (e.g., Time watch) as the focal point. •	Map consumer behavior patterns against Bellabeat Time watch features.", "•	Translate analytical findings into actionable marketing insights. •	Propose data-driven recommendations on how Bellabeat can position the selected product to align with consumer trends. •	Suggest potential customer segments to target based on observed behaviours.", "•	Deliver a clear, executive-ready report or presentation. •	Include visualizations, key findings, and prioritized recommendations. •	Ensure insights are accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.")

Scope_of_work <- data.frame(Activities, Description)
knitr::kable(Scope_of_work)
```

#### 1.7 Out of Scope Project Activities:
(a)	Collection of new proprietary data from Bellabeat customers
(b)	Produce financial forecasting or revenue modelling.
(c)	Execute marketing campaigns (only recommendations provided).

## 2. Prepare Phase
This phase of my report will focus on describing the data sources that I will use for this analysis, data reliabilty, data bias, Key performance indicators, visualizations that will be created to communicate findings to stakeholders, and analysis timeline.

#### 2.1 Data Source and Information:-
(a) Data source:- Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset will be retrieved from Mobius/Kaggle website below as directed by Urška Sršen, the co-founder and Chief Creative Office of Bellabeat company: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit

(b)	Accessibility and Licensing:- This dataset can be accessed by anyone given that it is CC0: public domain.

(c)	Anonymization:- The data set is anonymized, and no personally identifiable information is included.

(d)	Content:- This data set contains 18 tables with information on activity, calories, intensities, heart rate, sleep, and weight, often distributed by days, hours, and minutes from approximately 30 eligible Fitbit users.

(e)	Limitations: This dataset has several limitations as i have indicated below. But given that the data is generated by Fitbit, I can argue that it is reliable and is validated from the original source.

   (i)	Gender: There is no mention of the gender of the individuals who consented to submit their personal information. As such, lacking demographic usage. This is an important limitation for our analysis because Bellabeat’s products are created for use by women. This limitation can lead to bias within our data because we may be analyzing data on men, which can be significantly different to that of women.

   (ii)	Age: There is also no mention of the age of the participants. This means that it is possible that we may be analyzing data of only a specific age segment of the population, which would not represent the entire population

   (iii)	Out of date: The dataset is also not current because the data was collected in the year 2016.

**Remark**:- Unfortunately, I struggled to find other datasets on smart health device usage to supplement due to the fact that companies do not usually make this information public. However, I will simulate the gender and age group data from same Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset to help identify demographic usage trends. So I will complete the analysis with the provided dataset, taking into account its limitations and biases.

#### 2.2 Key Performance Indicators:-
(a)	Usage Frequency: Daily/weekly engagement with devices.
(b)	Activity Trends: Step counts, calories burned, active minutes.
(c)	Sleep Trends: Sleep duration, Sedentary Minutes, bedtime/wake patterns.
(d)	Engagement Correlation: How often users interact with their physical devices.

#### 6.4 Lessons Learned
(a) Behavior ≠ Intent: Users show high variability — engagement depends more on motivation cycles than demographics.
(b) Moderate Activity is the Sweet Spot: Users don’t want to be athletes; they want balance and achievable progress.
(c) Sleep Data is Underleveraged: Sleep metrics strongly predict wellness perception — key to emotional engagement.
(d) Personalization Drives Loyalty: Segmented, persona-based engagement has higher conversion potential than generic campaigns.
(e) Visualization Matters: Presenting clear, empathetic visuals (activity + sleep + heart-rate) creates stronger leadership understanding and buy-in.

#### 6.5 Conclusion
This data-driven analysis has provided Bellabeat with a clear, evidence-backed marketing roadmap for the Time smartwatch.
By understanding users’ lifestyle patterns and emotional motivators, Bellabeat can strengthen its market leadership in women’s wellness technology through empathetic, personalized, and data-guided engagement.

**Final Thought:**
The Bellabeat Time smartwatch should not be marketed merely as a wearable, but as a personal wellness companion — intelligently attuned to each user’s rhythm of life.
